Basketball Scoring App
**Built through UDACITY/GOOGLE tutorials**

Simple application designed to allow a user to track the scores of both teams playing a basketball match.

The aim of building this app through Udacity/Google, was to develop my knowledge of Android layouts in order to create a more aesthetic UI.
